A logo above is a good example. The fact of project having logo rises up its rank, but you don't need a fancy, fine-tuned and polished one. A logo that at first glance gives such impression will do. I've spent on this one 20% the time that professional design and creation would cost. The rest 80% of time that I would have to spend on redesign and polishing it to the perfection would have a little if any outcome. 

The same thing happens in knowledge. You dont need to be a specialist in every domain, but the primary knowledge of varius topics that revolve around your specialty makes you way better specialist. 

The primaries give you an overall look at some topic, and the knowledge where to look if details are neeeded.
