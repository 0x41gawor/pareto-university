## 3 Take that first tiny step

> No matter how small you start, start something that matters.

Most people find being productive so difficult because they psych themselves out, putting off each task until it seems insurmountable (*nie do pokonania*) task to get started.

Most people feel compelled (*zniewalająco*) to finish a task once it's been started.

- So make yourself a favor and commit to taking that first step. You will be surprised at how easily the rest comes by.

- Keeping your focus
  - It's nearly impossible to get intimidated by small, easy task.

```
Define the first step for every new task that appears. And just do it.
```

## 4 Be selective about your energy

You should to know which task only you can take care of, and which would be better off getting completed by others. This can be from ordering food online, to grocery shooping and cooking to having someone at work take notes for you.

It's impossible to be productive without saving your highest mental focus for appropriate tasks

```
Delegate tasks, which can be done by someone else.
E.g. preparing meals, cleaning up etc.
```



## 5 Tackle tasks in small chunks

Instead of going after an entire project at once or comminting to finishing everything in one day or sitting think instead of punching holes at a task one in a time.

- A period of five minutes dedicated to a task can easily turn into an hour or two when you really get into the zone of the work
  - It seems easier to tell ourselves we'll sit down for five to 10 minutes to work on smth than it does to commit to multiple hours.
- It's a type of mental hack that fools your mind into viewing task as less of a hassle, and you'd often find that sitting for longer becomes much easier that you'd expect.

It also give you more opportunity to the variety during the day.

- A lot of people struggle because they don't give enough varies in their routines. 

- Working on project for short periods of time, at a time, you can introduce plenty of variety into your day

By taking small chunks at a time, you are making the most of those sudden bursts of creativity that come to you

```
Divide tasks into small parts, and do them short perdiods of time, at a time.
Say to yourself you will do some task for 10 minutes, and you will see it will be easier to faill into doing it for hours.
```

## 6 Do the highest priority item on the list - first

- This will give you a clear cut picture of what needs to be focused on and will keep you from possible distractions (phone etc.).

- Seeing everything clearly will make u feel unstressed and comfortable. Making a list before bed means that you won't be lying there all night, trying to make sure you remember each task for the following day. Waking up more rested always measns more productive day.

- A defence against distractions
  - It's way too easy to get started on a goal for the day, be interrupted by a person or a phone call, and then completely lose track of what you were doing. If u will have a list, you will know what to do, no matter what event pops up.

- An encouraging checklist
  - Each time you check a goal off the list, you can feel empowered and extra energized to move on to the next one. Psychological trick.
