  <i>Reverse-engineering of a human civilization to uncover the necessary principles that, given biological, social, and material constraints, deterministically produced the present world order — and continue to govern it today.</i>

## Roadmap

- [X] Define lexicon-draft 
- [ ] Define constraints
  - [ ] Geography - Rivers, Mountains, Deserts, 
  - [ ] Climate - 
  - [ ] Soil fertility 
  - [ ] Animals as a biomass energy resources 
  - [ ] Energy resources (wood, stone, metals, coal etc..) 
- [ ] Create prehsitory snapshots these are more like a descriptions of species rather than snapshots, base on "Vienna capture"
- [ ] Define ethinicities
  - [ ] People from ages inhabited regions, what changes is their rulers, langauge, etc.. but genetic code survivies
  - [ ] Tree structure, each ethinicity grop contains its directory with readme and subdirs representing subethinicties
  - [ ] Start with 5-7 classes of world-level divion (Europe, Semitic, Indus, China, Malese, Native Americas, Native Oceania)

### Contents of files 

#### `contraints/readme.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“What could the world be built upon at all?”**

- geography  
- climate  
- access to natural resources  
- extraction of resources (metals, wood, stone, later coal, etc.)  
- energy base (biomass → animal power → water → etc.)  
- described statically in `geography.md`, but here treated dynamically: discoveries, adoption, and the beginning of exploitation  

This is **deterministic level 0**, on par with human psychology (which is intentionally excluded at this stage).
```

#### `01_technology_capabilities.md`

```sh
Answers the question: **“What were humans physically capable of doing?”**

- known technologies (materials, tools, processes)  
- what engineers / craftsmen actually did in practice:
  - what they built on a daily basis  
  - what constituted a technical problem  
  - what was impossible  
- infrastructure:
  - roads, canals, walls, ports, irrigation  
  - military tools as engineering artifacts  
- what was impossible, what was costly, and what was cheap and obvious in a given era  

This approach is far superior to a simple list of inventions with dates.
```

#### `02_economy_flows.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“What circulated through the system, and how?”**

- key goods  
- what drove economies (agriculture, trade, tribute, war)  
- forms of exchange (barter, money, credit, tribute)  
- who controlled surplus  
- major trade routes  

Economics is the study of resource distribution.

Without this layer, it is impossible to understand the state, which is, in essence, an organization managing economic flows.
```


#### `03_politics_coordination.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“How did humans coordinate action beyond the scale of a village?”**

Note that villages and settlements emerge organically. Coordinating at larger scales (cities, or cities + countryside = states) requires institutions.

- social structure  
- form of rule / governance  
- institutions (even primitive ones)  
- apparatus of coercion  
- center–periphery relations  

This layer is the system’s response to constraints defined in layers 1–3.  
The state is a response, not an idea.

- monarchy, republic, democracy  
- law  
- taxation  
- army  

➡ These emerge from material and structural conditions, not from philosophy.
```
#### `04_law_order.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“How were the rules of the game stabilized and enforced?”**

- customary law vs codified law  
- who enforced the law  
- who was subject to it  
- what the law looked like in practice  
- the relationship between law and power  

Law is not primary — it is a stabilizing mechanism.
```
#### `05_geopolitics_interaction.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“What happened when these orders collided?”**

- why conflicts occurred  
- what was fought over  
- main actors  
- balance of power  
- wars as consequences of structure, not personal ambition  
- expansion, defense, collapse  

This is macro-scale dynamics, not a catalog of battles — though battles should still be named, dated, and located.
```
#### `06_culture_art.md`
```sh
Answers the question: **“How did people understand and emotionally experience this world?”**

- art as commentary on the world order  

Culture is an output of the system, not an independent force (though it later feeds back into the system).

---
```
#### `06_philosophy_religion.md` 
```sh
Answers the question: **“How was the world order legitimized and rationalized in human minds?”**

- religion, philosophy, ideology, myths as tools of legitimization  

This layer comes last, because conditions and coordination precede sense-making.

> The same logic applies at the micro-scale.
```

### Purpose of the Snapshot Collection

The purpose of the snapshot collection is to develop an intuitive **“sense of an era.”**

After working through several snapshots, I should be able to:
- look at a given century  
- identify constraints in layers 1–3  
- intuitively feel what *must* happen next  

Ultimately, this should make present-day developments feel obvious and predictable, enabling me to choose my own strategy — whether personal or in business and projects — with clarity and confidence.
