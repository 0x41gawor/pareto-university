# Lexicon Draft — A. Meta-tools for Understanding History (Historiography)

This section contains analytical concepts used to interpret and reason about history.
These are **meta-tools**, not historical actors, institutions, or processes themselves.

## Periodization  
**PL:** periodyzacja

**Definition:**  
The division of historical time into distinct periods (epochs, ages, eras) based on dominant structural characteristics rather than continuous chronology.

**Why it matters:**  
History is continuous, but human cognition is not. Periodization allows us to:
- compare different eras,
- talk about long-term structures,
- avoid drowning in event-level detail.

**Examples:**  
- Stone Age → Bronze Age → Iron Age  
- Antiquity → Middle Ages → Early Modern Period

**Common pitfalls:**  
- treating periods as homogeneous or sharply bounded,
- assuming transitions were uniform everywhere.

## Relative Chronology  
**PL:** chronologia względna

**Definition:**  
Placing events in sequence relative to one another without assigning exact calendar dates.

**Why it matters:**  
For most of human history, absolute dating was impossible. Relative chronology allows reconstruction of sequences using logic, layers, and succession.

**Examples:**  
- Event A happened before Event B because it appears in a lower archaeological layer.  
- Dynasty X preceded Dynasty Y.

**Typical domains:**  
- archaeology  
- early history  
- prehistory

**Wikipedia:**

## Absolute Chronology  
**PL:** chronologia bezwzględna

**Definition:**  
Dating events using a fixed, calendar-based time scale (e.g. BCE / CE).

**Why it matters:**  
Allows synchronization:
- between regions,
- between political, technological, and cultural timelines.

**Examples:**  
- “The fall of Rome in 476 CE”  
- “Industrial Revolution began around 1760”

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology

---

## Epoch  
**PL:** epoka

**Definition:**  
A long period characterized by relatively stable structural conditions (technology, economy, institutions).

**Why it matters:**  
Some historical patterns persist long enough to justify treating time as segmented into coherent wholes.

**Examples:**  
- Neolithic epoch  
- Classical antiquity  
- Industrial era

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch

---

## Caesura  
**PL:** cezura  
(**NOT**: cenzura)

**Definition:**  
A conceptual break or rupture separating two historical phases.

**Why it matters:**  
Not all change is gradual. Some transitions involve collapse, discontinuity, or systemic reset.

**Examples:**  
- Fall of the Western Roman Empire  
- Black Death as a break in medieval Europe  
- World War I as a caesura in European order

**Common confusion:**  
- *Caesura* ≠ *censorship (cenzura)*  
- In Polish, *cezura* is also used in poetry (pause/break), which is conceptually related.

**Wikipedia:**

## Primary Sources  
**PL:** źródła pierwotne

**Definition:**  
Sources produced during the period being studied.

**Why it matters:**

- inscriptions  
- artifacts

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source

---

## Secondary Sources  
**PL:** źródła wtórne

**Definition:**  
Later interpretations, analyses, or syntheses of primary sources.

**Why it matters:**  
Primary sources require context, interpretation, and comparison.

**Examples:**  
- history textbooks  
- academic articles  
- historical monographs

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_source

---

## Source Criticism  
**PL:** krytyka źródeł

**Definition:**  
The systematic evaluation of sources for reliability, bias, context, and intent.

**Why it matters:**  
Sources reflect the interests, limitations, and worldview of their creators.

**Key questions:**  
- Who created this source?  
- For whom?  
- For what purpose?

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism

---

## Triangulation  
**PL:** triangulacja (źródeł)

**Definition:**  
Validating claims by cross-checking multiple independent sources or types of evidence.

**Why it matters:**  
No single source is sufficient for reliable conclusions.

**Examples:**  
- combining textual, archaeological, and economic evidence  
- verifying chronicles against material remains

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(social_science)

---

## Historiography  
**PL:** historiografia

**Definition:**  
The study of how history is written, interpreted, and reinterpreted over time.

**Why it matters:**  
Historical narratives are products of their own eras and intellectual climates.

**Examples:**  
- Enlightenment histories vs 20th-century social histories  
- nationalist vs global interpretations

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography

## Historiographical Schools  
**PL:** szkoły historiograficzne

- Institutional history  
- Cultural history

## Anachronism  
**PL:** anachronizm

**Definition:**  
The application of concepts, values, or categories from one time period to another where they do not belong.

**Why it matters:**  
It distorts understanding by ignoring historical constraints.

**Examples:**  
- calling ancient Athens a “modern democracy”

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism

---

## Presentism  
**PL:** prezentyzm

**Definition:**  
Interpreting the past through the lens of present-day values, norms, and concerns.

**Why it matters:**  
It leads to moral judgment instead of structural understanding.

**Examples:**

- assuming modern concepts were available or obvious

**Wikipedia:**  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(historical_analysis)
