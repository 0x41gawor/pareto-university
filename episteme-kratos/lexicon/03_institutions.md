# Lexicon Draft — C. Institutions and the State
(The core “why” of civilizational development)

This section covers institutions and state structures as coordination mechanisms.
These concepts explain how large-scale societies stabilize power, extract resources,
and enforce order beyond kinship and custom.

## Institutions (Formal vs Informal)  
**PL:** instytucje (formalne vs nieformalne)

**Definition:**  
Institutions are stable patterns of rules, norms, and practices that structure human interaction.

- **Formal institutions** — codified, explicit (laws, constitutions, offices)

**Why it matters:**  
Most societies function through a mix of both; formal institutions rarely work without informal support.

**Examples:**  
- formal: courts, taxation systems  
- informal: honor codes, patron–client relations
